Summary
=======

The aim of the CAMELS Multifield Challenge (CMC) project is to use machine learning algorithms to help astrophysicists to decipher the misteries of the Universe.

CMC contains a collection of hundreds of thousands of 2D maps with different properties of the comic gas, dark matter, stars, and black holes from 2,000 different universes that span tens of light years apart. Each of those images is characterized by 6 numbers: two cosmological parameters describing fundamental properties of the Universe and four astrophysical parameters that quantify the efficiency of astrophysical processes supernova explosions or feedback from black holes.

The main goal of CMC is to develop robust models that can infer the value of the two cosmological parameters from the maps with the highest accuracy.

The CMC maps also represents by itself a very large dataset to train machine learning algorithms to carry out different tasks.
