CAMELS Multifield Challenge (CMC)
=================================

The data from upcoming cosmological surveys may allow us to answer some of the most profounds questions in cosmology: What is the nature of dark energy? What is the absolute mass and hierarchy of neutrinos? How fast is the Universe expanding?

The main obstacle to accomplish this is not the quantity or quaility of the data, but the theoretical prediction needed to extract the relevant information from the data. Two difficult problems need to be overcomed: 1) the optimal summary statistic(s) needed to extract the maximum information from non-Gaussian density fields is unknown, and 2) the impact of astrophysical processes such as supernova and AGN feedback is poorly known.

In `Villaescusa-Navarro et al. 2020b  <https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05992>`_ we showed using toy examples that neural networks can find optimal estimators that allows to extract the maximum cosmological information while marginalizing over baryonic effects. 

The CAMELS Multifield Challenge (CMC) provides a set of hundreds of thousands of 2-dimensional maps from 15 different fields of the state-of-the-art (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations CAMELS as data to train machine learning algorithms, or traditional summary statistics, with the aim to extract the maximum cosmological information from them.

All data is publicly available together with the model and weights of the convolutional neural networks trained in `Villaescusa-Navarro et al. 2021a <>`_ that can be seen as the benchmark.
