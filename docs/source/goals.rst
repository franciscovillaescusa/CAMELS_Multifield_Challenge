Goals
=====

Each CMC map is characterized by 6 numbers: two cosmological parameters, :math:`\Omega_{\rm m}` (that quantifies the fraction of matter in the total energy content in the Universe) and :math:`\sigma_8` (that sets the amplitude of matter fluctuations), and 4 astrophysical parameters, :math:`A_{\rm SN1}`, :math:`A_{\rm SN2}`, :math:`A_{\rm AGN1}` and :math:`A_{\rm AGN2}`, which characterize the strength of the astrophysical processes (supernova and black hole, aka AGN, feedback).

CMC goals are:

- Build models to infer the value of the cosmological parameters with the highest accuracy.
- Build models that trained on one suite of simulations (e.g. IllustrisTNG) can infer the correct cosmology when tested on the other suite (e.g. SIMBA).
- Determine the minimum set of fields than contain 90% and 95% of the cosmological and astrophysical information.

We provide access to the benchmark models here
