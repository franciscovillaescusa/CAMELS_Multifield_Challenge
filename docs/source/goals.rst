Goals
=====

Each CMC map is characterized by 6 numbers: two cosmological parameters :math:`\Omega_{\rm m}` (that quantifies the fraction of matter over the total energy content in the Universe), and :math:`\sigma_8` (that set the variance of linear matter fluctuations), and 4 astrophysical parameters :math:`A_{\rm SN1}`, :math:`A_{\rm SN2}`, :math:`A_{\rm AGN1}`, :math:`A_{\rm AGN2}`, that characterized the strength of the astrophysical processes (supernova and AGN feedback).

CMC goals are:

- Build models to infer the value of the cosmological parameters with the highest accuracy.
- Build models that trained on one set of simulations (e.g. IllustrisTNG) can infer the correct cosmology when tested on the other set (e.g. SIMBA).
- Determine the minimum set of fields than contain 90% and 95% of the cosmological and astrophysical information.
