Download
========

All CMC data is hosted on the Rusty cluster of the `Flatiron Institute <https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron>`_, and can be downloaded in two different ways:

- Via `globus <https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=2be3b3c6-d752-11eb-8131-bbca43030bb4&origin_path=%2F>`_.
- Via `url <https://users.flatironinstitute.org/~fvillaescusa/priv/v0lBajuAlt1am6RxCiK0u0Whe9J20/CMC>`_.

While with the url the transfer is simple and convenient, it can be slow and unstable. We recommend using globus as it is the faster and more reliable way to transfer the data.

Structure
---------

CMC data is organized as follows:

- **2D\_maps**. This folder contains 2 subfolders:
  
  - **data**. All files with the images and the values of the cosmological and astrophysical parameters are here.

  - **benchmark**. Contains all scripts used to train and test the networks together with the network weights themselves.
    
- **3D\_grids**. This folder only contains 1 subfolder:

  - **data**. All files with the 3D grids and the value of the cosmological and astrophysical parameters are here.

The total data volume of the 2D maps is XXX, and of the 3D grids is XXX.
